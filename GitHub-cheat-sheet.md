------------------

These shortcuts work in a browser window, except within input fields.

* `?` -- general help
* `m` -- markdown cheat sheet (including custom github extensions)

URL hacks
---------

- github.com/user/repo/compare/{range}, where {range} is smart, for example:
  + master...my-branch
  + master@{1.day.ago}...master
  + master@{yesterday}...master
  + master@{2012-12-12}...master

- can link to specific lines: click on line to add #LNUMBER
- can link to range of lines
