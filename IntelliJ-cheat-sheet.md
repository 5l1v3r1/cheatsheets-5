IntelliJ cheat sheet
====================

My cheat sheet of IntelliJ (and PyCharm) shortcuts.

Initial setup
-------------

- Open settings:
  <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd> or <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>

- Disable spell checking:
  - Filter by *"spell"*, and then: **Inspections / Spelling / Typo**

- Ensure line feed at file end:
  - Filter by *"end of line"*, and then: **Editor / Ensure line feed at file end on Save**

- Jump to high priority errors first:
  - Filter by *"next error"*, and then: **Editor / 'Next Error' action goes to high priority problems only**

- Show line numbers:
  - Filter by: *"line num"*, and then: **Editor / Appearance / Show line numbers**

Misc
----

- Click on `implements` keyword to highlight overridden methods
- Click on a `return` or `throw` keyword to highlight all exit points from a method

Macros
------

Macros are useful to insert code templates.

To run macros, just type the letters where you want to insert it in the code,
and press the trigger key (see shortcuts above).

    sout        insert System.out.println()
    iter        insert for-each iterator to iterate over an iterable in the current scope
