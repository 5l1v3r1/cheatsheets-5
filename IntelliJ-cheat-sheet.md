My cheat sheet of IntelliJ (and PyCharm) shortcuts.


Initial setup
-------------

- Open settings:
  <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> or <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd>

- Disable spell checking:
  - Filter by *"spell"*, and then: **Inspections / Spelling / Typo**

- Ensure line feed at file end:
  - Filter by *"end of line"*, and then: **Editor / Ensure line feed at file end on Save**

- Jump to high priority errors first:
  - Filter by *"next error"*, and then: **Editor / 'Next Error' action goes to high priority problems only**

- Show line numbers:
  - Filter by: *"line num"*, and then: **Editor / Appearance / Show line numbers**
