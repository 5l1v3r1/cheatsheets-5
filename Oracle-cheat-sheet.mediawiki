== How to ... ? ==

;How to limit rows?:
 select ... where rownum < 20;

;How to show tables with row count?:
 select table_name, num_rows from user_tables;

... well, this is a lie... I guess the <code>num_rows</code> column is a cached value, not the actual current value. But it's fast, and might still be a good measure of the relative table sizes.

;How to unlock accounts?:
As the oracle admin user (probably oracle), run <code>sqlplus</code>, connect with <code>/ as sysdba</code>

 alter user scott account unlock;
 connect scott/tiger

When connecting for the first time, oracle will ask to change the account password. (JDBC, ODP accesses will fail if you don't do this step.)

;How to duplicate a table?:
 create table dept_bak as select * from dept;

This will not duplicate constraints though.

;How to add unique constraint to a table?:
 alter table dept_bak add constraint u_dept unique (deptno);

== Starting the database ==

With the <code>oracle</code> user.

# <code>lsnrctl start</code>
#: If you do this multiple times, not a problem, it just gives you an error.
# <code>dbstart</code>
#: If this does not work, you can try this alternative method:

 $ sqlplus

== Stopping the database ==

With the <code>oracle</code> user.

# <code>dbsshut</code>
#: If this does not work, you can try to shutdown manually:

 $ sqlplus

== Quickies ==

* <code>connect / as sysdba</code>
* <code>connect sys/password as sysdba</code>
* How to create new password file:
** stop database
** <code>orapwd file=$ORACLE_HOME/dbs/orapw$ORACLE_SID password=mypasswd</code>
** start database
* Alter user:
 ALTER USER scott ACCOUNT LOCK;     -- lock a user account
 ALTER USER scott ACCOUNT UNLOCK;   -- unlocks a locked users account
 ALTER USER scott PASSWORD EXPIRE;  -- Force user to choose a new password
 
 ALTER USER scott IDENTIFIED BY newtiger;

* Create/drop user:
 CREATE USER scott
     IDENTIFIED BY tiger  -- Assign password
     DEFAULT TABLESACE  tools -- Assign space for table and index segments
     TEMPORARY TABLESPACE temp; -- Assign sort space
 
 DROP USER scott CASCADE;  -- Remove user

* After creating a new user, assign the required privileges:
 GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO scott;
 GRANT DBA TO scott;   -- Make user a DB Administrator

* Remember to give the user some space quota on its tablespaces:
 ALTER USER scott QUOTA UNLIMITED ON tools;

* Accounts locked by default: scott/tiger, hr/hr, oe/oe, sh/sh, system/manager (as sysdba!)

* Logical backup and recovery:
 exp file=/tmp/exp.dmp log=/tmp/exp.log
 imp file=/tmp/exp.dmp log=/tmp/imp.log
