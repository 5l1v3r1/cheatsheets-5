The slightly odd word, `void-function`, is designed to cover the way Emacs Lisp is implemented,
which is that when a symbol does not have a function de nition attached to it,
the place that should contain the instructions is void.

Symbols can have both a value and a function associated to them.

### Emacs

Run lisp expression: `c-x c-e`
