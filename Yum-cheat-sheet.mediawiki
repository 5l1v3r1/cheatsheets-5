* <code>yum grouplist > yum.grouplist</code>
** Example package group: "GNOME Desktop Environment".
** Since yum is darn slow, I usually save the output of such commands once and just grep in the cache later.
** <code> yum groupinstall "GNOME Desktop Environment"</code>

* <code>yum list > yum.list</code>
** Since yum list is very slow, it's faster to do my searches in a file instead.

* <code>yum list installed</code>
